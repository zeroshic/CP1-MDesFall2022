    <p>My initial objective was to create a set of 25 square boxes overlapping each other with a bit of transparency to create a gradient and add a button to change the color. However, I struggled to develop a simple math code to create multiple boxes in a row. Therefore, I made each box manually by giving a form and position element. The first script exceeded 160 lines, and I simplified it to 86. I used the PosX/PosY concept from the previous class to make it easy to adjust the positioning. As a result, I completed the box gradient reasonably fast. </p>

    <p>The most challenging part was to add a button to change the color. I took the button input src from the previous class to create a random RGB number and apply it to each box fill. However, it couldn't generate the number in the new script, so I researched and found the Var option. I individually assigned r,g,b,a, combined them with a random number, and applied them to each box. Since the button wasn't working, I used the mouse press/release as an alternative to play/pause color change.</p>
