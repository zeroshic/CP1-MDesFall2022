                                   about him. Life’s work, political aspirations.
                               Him and the pope. Sexual orientation. The whole
                           works,right? I bet you can’t tell me what it smells like
                  in the Sistine Chapel. You never actually stood there and
                 looked up at that beautiful ceiling. Seeing that. If I ask you about
                 women, you’ll probably give                  me a syllabus of your
                   personal favorites.                                 You may have even
                       been                                                   aid a few times.
